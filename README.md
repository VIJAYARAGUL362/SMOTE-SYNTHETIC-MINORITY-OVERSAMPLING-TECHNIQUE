# SMOTE-SYNTHETIC-MINORITY-OVERSAMPLING-TECHNIQUE
This notebook demonstrates how to address imbalanced datasets using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) in Python. It uses a simple example dataset with animal characteristics (height and weight) to illustrate the process of oversampling the minority class and visualizing the resulting balanced data.
